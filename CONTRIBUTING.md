# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to **Ligero**! I hope that this open source package is useful to you, and I would definitely appreciate any comments or suggestions for improvements.

## Purpose

This package primarily targets developers working with the Laravel framework who need to scaffold an application with CRUD capabilities, and would like to have maximum flexibility and extensibility in their implementations.

I believe it can also provide some great benefits for front-end developers who would like to receive all the necessary data for a dynamic UI in one bundle and keep logic out of the templates.

## Project Vision

**Ligero** is envisioned as a core or foundation which can be extended to provide more complex or specialized functions.

As stated in the project [README](README.md), the goal is to provide a versatile, extensible CRUD micro-framework that can be easily understood and deployed, while integrating all the necessary component types, following SOLID design principles, and enabling rapid modelling of domains in a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) fashion. In other words, a sort of Swiss Army Knife, which favors simplicity and general utility over specialization.

## Roadmap

At this point, regarding contributions, I would like to focus on the existing features, and look forward to hearing how the package performs and what is good or bad about it from the developer's perspective. Suggestions for new features are certainly welcome, but their implementation will only come after I have gotten enough initial feedback to prioritize new feature development.

I would especially like to see examples of deployment, including front-end design that really takes advantage of the built-in dynamic data output capabilities. At some point I would like to offer a "starter kit" of templates and skins to get people up and running quickly with designs for various types of sites, so this may be a way for designers to showcase their works.
